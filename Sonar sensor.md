# Sonar Sensor

## Introduction

A Sonar sensor, also known as an ultrasonic sensor, is a device that uses sound waves to detect objects or obstacles in its vicinity. It works on the principle of sending out sound waves and measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back, allowing it to calculate the distance to the object.

## Uses 

Sonar sensors are commonly used in robotics, automation, and IoT projects for object detection, distance measurement, collision avoidance, and navigation.

To use a Sonar sensor, you need to connect it to a microcontroller or development board, typically using VCC, GND, and TRIG/echo pins.
The provided code snippet in Arduino demonstrates how to measure distance using a Sonar sensor and print the result in centimeters.

## How do I wire a Sonar sensor?

#### Wiring Instructions

###### HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Pinout:

+ VCC: Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
- GND: Connect to the GND pin on the Arduino.
* Trig: Connect to any digital pin on the Arduino for triggering the sensor.
+ Echo: Connect to another digital pin on the Arduino for receiving the echo signal.

###### Arduino Connection:

+ Connect the VCC pin of the sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
- Connect the GND pin of the sensor to the GND pin on the Arduino.
* Connect the Trig pin of the sensor to a digital pin on the Arduino.
+ Connect the Echo pin of the sensor to another digital pin on the Arduino.

## Code Explanation

 This code snippet initializes the sensor pins, triggers the sensor, measures the distance, and prints the result to the serial monitor.

 
<div style="background-color: rgb(50, 50, 50);">

```cpp

const int trigPin = 9;
const int echoPin = 10;
long duration;
int distance;

void setup() {
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.println(distance);
}
```

</div>
 
This code snippet sets up the Sonar sensor, triggers it to send out a sound wave, and calculates the distance based on the time it takes for the echo to return. It then prints the distance measured in centimeters to the serial monitor.

## FAQ

#### what are the factors to consider when choosing a sonar sensor for a project?

When choosing a Sonar sensor for a project, consider factors like detection range, accuracy, environmental conditions, cost, technical expertise, and user reviews to ensure optimal performance and compatibility with project requirements.

#### How do ultrasonic sensors work in robotics?

Ultrasonic sensors emit sound waves towards an object and calculate the distance by detecting the reflected waves. These sensors consist of a transmitter that emits sound using piezoelectric crystals and a receiver that captures the reflected sound.
