The IBT-2 Motor Driver is a dual-channel H-bridge motor driver module capable of controlling two DC motors independently. It is based on the popular IBT-2 chipset, known for its reliability and efficiency. The driver operates by controlling the direction and speed of DC motors through pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals.

### Key Features

- Dual-channel H-bridge configuration
- Maximum continuous output current: 43A
- Operating voltage range: 5.5V to 27V
- PWM frequency: Up to 25kHz

## Wiring the IBT-2 Motor Driver

Proper wiring is crucial to ensure the IBT-2 Motor Driver functions correctly and safely. Here's a basic wiring guide:

- **Power Supply**: Connect the positive and negative terminals of the power supply (5.5V to 27V) to the corresponding terminals on the motor driver.

- **Motor Connections**: Attach the DC motors to the motor output terminals of the driver. Ensure correct polarity for proper motor direction control.

- **Control Signals**: Connect the PWM control signals from your microcontroller or other control devices to the input terminals (IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4) of the motor driver. These signals determine the motor speed and direction.

- **Ground Connection**: Connect the ground terminals of the power supply, motors, and control devices to the ground terminal of the motor driver.

## Controlling Motors with IBT-2

Controlling motors with the IBT-2 Motor Driver involves sending appropriate PWM signals to the input pins. The following steps outline the basic process:

- **Set Motor Direction**: To set the motor direction, apply logic HIGH or LOW to the appropriate control pins (IN1, IN2 for Motor 1 and IN3, IN4 for Motor 2). Refer to the datasheet for specific pin configurations.

- **Control Motor Speed**: Vary the duty cycle of the PWM signal sent to the corresponding control pin. Higher duty cycles result in faster motor speeds.

- **Start/Stop Motor**: To start or stop the motor, toggle the control pins accordingly. For example, setting both control pins to the same logic level stops the motor.

Here's a basic Arduino sketch to control two DC motors using the IBT-2 Motor Driver:

```cpp
// Define pin numbers
const int motor1_IN1 = 2;
const int motor1_IN2 = 3;
const int motor2_IN3 = 4;
const int motor2_IN4 = 5;

void setup() {
  // Initialize motor control pins as outputs
  pinMode(motor1_IN1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor1_IN2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2_IN3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2_IN4, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Move motor 1 forward
  digitalWrite(motor1_IN1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motor1_IN2, LOW);

  // Move motor 2 forward
  digitalWrite(motor2_IN3, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motor2_IN4, LOW);

  // Adjust motor speed using PWM
  analogWrite(motor1_IN1, 150); // Adjust PWM value for desired speed
  analogWrite(motor2_IN3, 200); // Adjust PWM value for desired speed

  // Add delay to maintain motor speed and direction
  delay(1000);

  // Stop motors
  digitalWrite(motor1_IN1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor1_IN2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor2_IN3, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor2_IN4, LOW);

  // Delay before next movement
  delay(1000);
