## Rain Sensor with Arduino

A rain sensor is a module used to detect the presence of water or raindrops. It's commonly used in weather stations, irrigation systems, and automatic car wipers.

### Operating Voltage

Rain sensors typically operate at a voltage range of 3.3V to 5V, making them compatible with most Arduino boards.

### Wiring the Rain Sensor

1. Connect the rain sensor's `VCC` (power) wire to the Arduino's `5V` pin.
2. Connect the rain sensor's `GND` (ground) wire to any `GND` pin on the Arduino.
3. Connect the rain sensor's `Signal` (analog or digital) wire to an analog or digital pin on the Arduino (depending on the sensor type).

### Reading Data from the Rain Sensor

1. Read the analog or digital signal from the rain sensor using the appropriate function (e.g., `analogRead()` for analog sensors or `digitalRead()` for digital sensors).
2. Interpret the sensor data to determine the presence or absence of rain based on the threshold value.

### Important Consideration: Threshold Adjustment

Adjust the threshold value based on environmental conditions and the sensitivity of the rain sensor. Fine-tuning the threshold ensures accurate detection of rain.

### Sample Code

```cpp
// Analog Rain Sensor Example

#define RAIN_SENSOR_PIN A0

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(RAIN_SENSOR_PIN);
  
  if (sensorValue > 500) {
    Serial.println("It's raining!");
  } else {
    Serial.println("No rain detected");
  }
  
  delay(1000);
}
