# Transformer
## Introduction
The Transformer is a deep learning model introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. It revolutionized natural language processing tasks by introducing the self-attention mechanism, eliminating the need for recurrent or convo lutional layers. Transformers have since become the backbone of many state-of-the-art models in NLP, such as BERT, GPT, and Transformer-XL.

## Uses
+ Transformers are extensively utilized in a variety of NLP tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and question answering.
- They excel at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, allowing them to understand the context and relationships between different elements in a text effectively.
* Transformers have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional models, showcasing their ability to process and generate coherent text with a deeper understanding of language patterns and structures.

 ## Wiring 
 The core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different input tokens when making predictions. The Transformer architecture consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. Each layer processes the input sequentially, updating the representations of tokens based on their relationships with other tokens.
  ## Code Explanation

  ```
  // Define Transformer class
class Transformer {
public:
    // Constructor
    Transformer(int num_layers, int d_model, int num_heads, int d_ff) {
        // Initialize Transformer parameters
        // Implement Transformer architecture
    }

    // Forward pass function
    void forward(vector<vector<float>> input) {
        // Implement forward pass through Transformer layers
    }

    // Backward pass function
    void backward(vector<vector<float>> gradients) {
        // Implement backward pass for training
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a Transformer model
    Transformer transformer(6, 512, 8, 2048);

    // Input data
    vector<vector<float>> input = {{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}};

    // Forward pass
    transformer.forward(input);

    // Backward pass
    vector<vector<float>> gradients = {{0.1, 0.2, 0.3}, {0.4, 0.5, 0.6}};
    transformer.backward(gradients);

    return 0;
}
  ```

This code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation of a Transformer in C++. You can customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process based on your specific requirements.
